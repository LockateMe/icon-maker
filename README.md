# icon-maker

A small tool to mask and resize your icon for iOS and Android apps

## Motivation

Because there 2 main mobile platforms today, and that each one of them require to have your app icon in multiple sizes to fit its multiple uses, you may waste quite a lot of time with a repetitive `resize & export` tasks. Hence I wrote a little tool that will hopefully do all of this for you.

I've been writing this will working on a Phonegap/Cordova-based app.
